Sketch of Simple Cooperative Platform
=====================================

This is a sketch of an **unfinished** app for simple multiuser platform. A user can create groups and invite other users to share choices from vegetarian restaurants as listed from Google Places.

The sketch operates mainly by url parameters. It doesn't save sessions and is completely anonymous.

In order to register for a first group, the url should be completed with the following parameters:
`googlemaps/user`. An user id and a group id will be assigned and a group will be started.

From there, other users can be added to the group as long as they are also registered.

Other groups could be also started.

Pressing the `Test` button users registered in any group can add choices of places and see them all in the group profile.
